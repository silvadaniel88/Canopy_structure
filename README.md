# Canopy_structure
 Clasify images and extract data from Can Eye result (html)

Use FH_threshold v1.1 to apply the isodata algorithm to your photos (JPG). 
To work as it is, the photos must be in a sub-folder inside the sample unit folder (e.g. 'C:/Documents/canopy_plots/plot_1/photos').
In the beggining of the script you must inform the main folder that contains the folder of all sample plots (e.g. 'C:/Documents/canopy_plots'). 

To extract the results from the Can_eye html files simply inform the folder where all Can_Eye result folders are saved.
